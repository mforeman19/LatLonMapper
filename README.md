# Latitude and Longitude Mapper using Scala JS
## Project Description

** The Scala file that is used for this project is found in src/main/scala/tutorial/webapp within the project folder

This web page takes in a two user inputs for latitude and longitude values and then returns a map using Google Maps API onto the webpage based on the values entered. 

For this project, I used [Scala JS](https://www.scala-js.org/), a tool built to convert Scala into Javascript. If you are unfamiliar with Scala JS, I recommend working through their basic tutorial. It served as the base for this project. I also used the [Scala JS Google Maps library](https://github.com/coreyauger/scalajs-google-maps) to process the Google Maps query and display a map on the webpage. 

### Author's Notes
For this personal project, I wanted to play around with the capabilities of Scala. Using Scala as a front-end language for a website seemed to be fairly unconventional for the language, so it seemed exciting to try. If you are interested in Scala JS, I do recommend it if you are looking for a typesafe and easy-to-read language in comparison to standard Javascript.
